# Code Review

Code review written by [Douglas Lindahl](https://github.com/DouglasLindahl).

1. `index.php:23-24` - Remember to add "**DIR**" when requiring files
2. `index.php:40` - "main-photos" only contains a single photo. perhaps use a name such as "main-photo-container"
3. `index.php:36` - it is unnecessary to add class = "header" when using a <header></header>
4. `grid.css:74` - Comments in css are made with /_ css _/. not //
5. `example.js:10-15` - More comments would be good
